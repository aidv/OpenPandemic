# OpenPandemic

This repository contains resources that are beneficial before, during and after a pandemic.

The content of this repository contains anything from PPE to guidelines on an individual, social, and all the way up to political level.

Anyone to wishes to contribute to this repository must make all resources easy to understand and with clear instructions.

## Requirements

Each project must follow strict guidelines on how the project is presented as such (might change in the future):

- Introduction of project (short summary of what the project's purpose and what it acomplishes)
- Technical explanation, preferrably using graphics (i.e a drawing to demonstrate how it's executed, with notation)
- Notations (which explains why it accomplishes "it" and it's importance)

These three requirements should be applicable to anything, even for a simple task such as washing hands.



## Efficiency

It's very important that each project is efficient in it's nature.

Price of manufacturing a project should always be pushed down if possible,
wile it's benefits should increase.

## Rating

Each project will be rated by time efficiency (not to be confused with previous buletin "Efficiency")
in order to deploy it as fast as possible.

For example: Masks

It's has been proven that any mask at scale will have a positive effect to battle a pandemic,
so even a home-made mask made from a cotton based fabric, such as a T-Shirt, used by a large group of people will potentially save thousands of lives.

## Final Words

Even if this repo becomes obsolete for whatever reason, the knowledge is documented here, and
anyone can refer to this repository at any given time for inspiration.
